                            The gaming industry is already providing and influencing a significant portion of the metaverse's foundational technology. Beyond technology, 
                            its business models are likewise being adapted and leveraged across industries. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            The video, music, sports, fitness, medicine, education, and industrial training industries (among others) are already 
                            borrowing from gaming so much so that it's become a word: gamification - which means the gaming industry's problems are very likely to translate soon to other verticals and the emerging metaverse.

                            The value often isn't in personally identifiable information (PII); it's in the account
                            itself. From gaming, we've learned that the accounts themselves have value in the form of a player's time and in-game items. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Stolen gaming accounts that reflect lots of time played and that have accumulated cool gear allow purchasers of those stolen accounts to play at a high level without putting in the effort. 
                            In-game goods can also be sold in third-party markets for real cash.

                            This form of virtual value is already being reflected in the investment community with people buying up NFTS, another area rife with cybersecurity challenges. 
                            So, as the world, and your business, move toward operating in the metaverse, securing accounts and access will become more complex and require accounting for the varied account behavior of users.

                            Cybercriminals are highly focused on industries such as gaming, in which the user community has disposable income and makes frequent transactions. the gaming industry continues to be pummeled with web application attacks. Across industries, these type of attacks are prevalent in the security operations center, accounting for more than half of all data breaches.

                            The key is to focus on Incorporating security-by-design principles. Developers must incorporate security-minded criteria into their designs, products and infrastructures. For example, developers should work to minimize attack surface areas, secure defaults and zero-trust frameworks, and ensure separate and minimal privileges. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Technologies must come secondary to the principles that inform their designs
                            The need to align cross-industry cybersecurity strategies. As every company moves to do business in the metaverse, partnership with your customers and employees around account security will become a larger part of the customer experience and the brand relationship, expanding security's role in the enterprise.

                            As you move more into the metaverse and other web 3.0 technology, your organization's attack surface will grow exponentially. To keep that "other world" turning, cybersecurity strategies will need to better align.
